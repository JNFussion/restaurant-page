## Restaurant Page

This project is from [The odin project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

It's a simple fake restaurant page. The goal of the project is to learn the basics of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and practise the use of ES6 Modules.
